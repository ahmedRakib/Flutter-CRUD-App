# front-end-for-cross-ussage
Building a Frontend for cross-usage (2p bonus)
Learning goals: Students can...
repeat pros/cons of at least three cross-plattform development frameworks for web-android-iOS or android-IOS)
describe the underlying system architecture needed to let cross-plafform code sharing work (logic, backend-communication, frontend UI and OS system API access)
follow a prototype development guideline including deployment to at least two plattforms (web, android, iOS).
Minimum aspects to cover: Flutter, Xamarin, React Native (for all three the basic first steps and requirements like dev-environment, coding languages, features and limitations, strength and weaknesses, detailed coding solution in one of the frameworks with the minimum functionality of list-display of some items, editing and save changes of one of the items (real persistence backend, but no login/auth needed), demonstrating deployment to two target platforms (for Android or iOS emulator is sufficient)
